Problem Description
In a left rotation, elements of an array are shifted to the left by k positions, and the first k elements are placed at the end of the array. For example:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Solution Approach
The solution:

Shifts each element in the array to the left by one position in a loop until k rotations are achieved.
Moves the first k elements to the end without using slicing, keeping it efficient and simple.
