Problem Description
Given an array, the task is to move all the zero elements to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

Example:
Input:
6
0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]
Solution Approach
The algorithm works by:

Iterating through the array and shifting all non-zero elements to the front.
Filling the remaining positions with zeros after all non-zero elements are moved.
This is done in-place to optimize memory usage.
